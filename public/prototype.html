      <p>I started out doing "backend programming" in PHP back in 2011 and it has been my main language for jobs.</p>
      <p>In 2021 I began brushing up on my JavaScript and I'm now a big fan of Typescript and have tried many of the
        different frameworks out there, with <a href="https://svelte.dev">Svelte</a> being my favourite.</p>
      <p>Outside of work I've done various small apps and scripts in TypeScript, PHP and Python (mostly for customizing Linux), some of which can be
        found here on the site.</p>
